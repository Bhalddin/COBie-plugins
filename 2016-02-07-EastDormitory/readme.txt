Dormitory - Early Design (30%) Phase

ALL INFO AVAILABLE ON http://prairieskyconsulting.com/testing.htm 

Rob Jackson used a publicly released set of concept design drawings to simulate the early design in ARCHICAD of one of four dormitories on a fictous site adjacent to the University of Illinois, Champaign, Illinois, USA. This model was developed as if it were being developed for a real client.

The results of this effort demonstrated 100% compliance with ARCHICAD against NBIMS-US V3, Design Stage COBie requirements.

A set of step-by step instructions for using ARCHICAD is now being compiled and will be published in the Spring of 2016
